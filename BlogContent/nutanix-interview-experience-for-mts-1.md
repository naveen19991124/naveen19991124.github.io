Preparing for a technical interview can be nerve-wracking, but the experience can also be a great opportunity to showcase your skills and learn more about a company's culture.

I recently had the chance to interview at **_Nutanix_** for the position of **_Member of Technical Staff 1(MTS-1)_**, and I can offer a firsthand account of what the interview experience was like and share insights that could help other job seekers prepare for success.

## Application Process

I applied for the opening for MTS-1 through LinkedIn. I connected with one of the folks working at Nutanix for the referral and was contacted by the recruiter within a week of applying to the position.

**Interview Structure**

1. Round-0 (HackerRank Test)
2. Round-1 (Face-To-Face Interview)
3. Rount-2 (Face-To-Face Interview)
4. Rount-3 (Hiring Manager)

## Round-0 (HackerRank Test)

In this round, I was given a link for attempting a HackerRank test based on Data Structures and Algorithms. The test consisted of 2 questions, and both of them were of medium difficulty.

The first question was based on _Disjoint Set Union(DSU)_ data structure, and was a basic application of DSU where one needs to formulate the problem statement in the form a graph with nodes and edges following which you need to find disjoint connected components.

The second question was based on _Meet In The Middle_ technique, where the problem also required sorting and two-pointer method. Overall the problem could have been partially solved using _Dynamic Programming_, with the provided constraints and test cases.

**Verdict:** I was able to solve both the problems completely and within a week, the recruiter contacted me and the hiring team scheduled 2 rounds of Face-To-Face interview on the same day. The rounds were not eliminatory, instead the evaluation criteria was the overall performance of both the rounds.

## Round-1 (Face-To-Face Interview)

In this round, I and the interviewer started with a brief introduction. The interviewer gave me 2 questions based on Data Structures and Algorithms. Both the questions were of easy-medium difficulty.

The first question was to build a cache system for gmail, it was quite similar to designing a _LRU Cache_, where instead of Least Recently Used, we can check for Least Recently Arrived in order of arrival timestamps of emails.

The second question was a graph problem, and a simple implementation and knowledge of a single source shortest path algorithm like _Dijkstra_ will solve the problem.

**Verdict:** I was able to solve both the problems completely.

## Round-2 (Face-To-Face Interview)

In this round, again I and the interviewer started with a brief introduction. The interviewer asked my about my previous work based on my resume, and was also asked some follow-up questions for which a basic understanding of operating systems was required.

Then the interviewer gave me a Low Level Design(LLD) question, where I was asked to design an _In-Memory-File-System_. I followed the typical guidelines for designing and solving a system design problem starting with clarifying the requirements, asking some questions and then incrementally building the solution.

A good understanding of _OOPS_ is a must, and knowledge of SOLID principles and Design Patterns will be a plus point for solving the question.

**Verdict:** I was able to satisfy the functional requirements, and got a call within 2 days from the recruiter for the Hiring Manager round.

## Round-3 (Hiring Manager)

This was a typical cultural-fit round, where I was greeted by my Hiring Manager, where we exchanged our introductions, followed by which I was asked questions about my previous work and the challenges I face. A good thorough read of your resume and using the _STAR_ technique to answer the questions would suffice for this round.

**Verdict:** The hiring manager confirmed me about my selection for the position of MTS-1 for the team, Yay!!üéâ

## Overall Experience

The overall interview experience was quite smooth and fast. I enjoyed the problems and being able to clear the interview process of Nutanix was a joy and cherry on top for me.ü•≥

**_That's all folks!! Until next time. „Åï„Çà„Å™„Çâ (sayonara)_**
